// Description:
// A simple reusable barrier implemented using an atomic integer and unbuffered channel
// Issues:
// None I hope
//1. Change mutex to atomic variable
//2. Make it a reusable barrier
//--------------------------------------------

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
)

// Place a barrier in this function --use Mutex's and Semaphores
func doStuff(goNum int, count *int32, max int32, wg *sync.WaitGroup, theChan *chan bool, theChan2 *chan bool) bool {
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		mCount := atomic.AddInt32(count, 1) //Atomic integer instead of mutex lock
		if mCount == max {                  //Each goroutine has their own count to check
			*theChan2 <- true //Last goroutine signals the previous ones to move and waits in the next line
			<-*theChan2
		} else {
			<-*theChan2       //If the goroutine isn't the last one, stay here
			*theChan2 <- true //once we get through send signal to next routine to continue including the last one
		} //end of if-else
		fmt.Println("Part A", goNum)

		mCount = atomic.AddInt32(count, -1) //Adding minus one since there's no option for subtraction
		//similar mechanism as above barrier. The above barrier is required since there's a chance that one goroutine might be too fast and output Part A while others are still on Part B
		if mCount == 0 { //last to arrive -signal others to go
			*theChan <- true
			<-*theChan
		} else { //not all here yet we wait until signal
