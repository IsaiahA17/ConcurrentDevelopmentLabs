dinPhil.go is a solution to the dining philosophers problem in which 5 goroutines (representing the philosophers) and a map of boolean channels that can be accessed by an integer index (representing the forks required to eat). Each philosopher must have access to two forks in order to eat, otherwise they are thinking. Only one philosopher may hold a fork at a time however creating a problem since the problem requires at least more than one philosopher should be able to eat at a time.
